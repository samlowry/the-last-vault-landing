After she passed, I would scroll through our timeline every night, reading her posts and seeing her smile in thousands of photos. Then Facebook suspended my account for 'copyright violations' because I posted a video of us dancing to a copyrighted song at our wedding. When I appealed, they permanently deleted everything. Eight years of our life together, gone. Her last post saying 'I love you' the morning of the accident - erased forever.",

      story: "Mom started recording stories about our family history when she was first diagnosed, hoping to preserve them before her memory faded. We had hours of her talking about great-grandparents, old traditions, recipes, and family secrets. They were on my brother's laptop when his house flooded. All those stories, all that history - it died with her twice. Once in her mind, and once in that water.",
